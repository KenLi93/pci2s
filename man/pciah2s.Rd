pciah2s(
  Y,
  D,
  A,
  X = NULL,

  Z = NULL,

\arguments{
\item{Y}{an n-vector of observed time to event outcomes}

\item{D}{an n-vector of event indicators for Y}

\item{A}{an n-vector of primary exposure}

\item{X}{an n * nX matrix of adjusted covariates , can be empty}

\item{W}{an n * nW matrix of negative control outcome (NCO)}

\item{Z}{an n * nZ matrix of negative control exposure (NCE). Alternatively,
the NCE can be included in the design matrix of the first-stage model by specifying
Xw}

\item{Xw}{a matrix with n rows or a list of length nW, each element is a design matrix of
the corresponding NCO. Default is a matrix with columns of A, Z, X, and interactions between
A, Z and A, X}

\item{Xy}{a matrix with n rows, covariates to be adjusted for in the second-stage
model besides A and predictors for W. This may include interaction between A and columns of X.
Default to be X}

\item{nco_type}{An nW-vector for the types of models used in the first-stage, including
"linear" (linear model), "loglin" (log-linear model), "poisson" (Poisson regression model),
"negbin" (negative-binomial regression model), and "ah" (Lin \& Ying's additive hazards model)}

\item{nco_args}{A list of length nW containing additional arguments for the first-stage models.
Each element in the list is a sublist and should contain a vector named "offset" (default 0).
If nco_type == "ah", the sublist needs to include another vector named "event" as the event indicator
(default 1). If nco_type == "negbin", the sublist needs to include a vector "init" as the initial values,
which can be NA.}

\item{se_method}{Method to compute the standard error, can be one of "all", "analytic", "exponential multiplier",
"gaussian multiplier" or "none".}
}
\value{
A list with three elements: ESTIMATE includes the parameter estimates from the second-stage
model; SE produces their standard error, and PARAM includes all parameter estimates
}
\description{
'pciah2s()' computes the adjusted hazard difference using additive hazards model by
Lin \& Ying 1994, using a pair of negative control variable to control for unmeasured
confounding
